## General

AWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine compatible with [Amazon Elastic Container Service](./ecs.html) and [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](./eks.html).

The containers are created by Fargate based on a *task definition*.

Easy to scale: only need to increase/decrease the desired number of tasks.
